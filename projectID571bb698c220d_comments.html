<HTML><BODY><h2>About the Author</h2>

<p>David Friedrich Strauss (January 27, 1808 in Ludwigsburg – February 8, 1874 in Ludwigsburg) was a German liberal Protestant theologian and writer, who scandalized Christian Europe with his portrayal of the "historical Jesus", whose divine nature he denied. His work was connected to the Tübingen School, which revolutionized study of the New Testament, early Christianity, and ancient religions. Strauss was a pioneer in the historical investigation of Jesus. (From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Strauss">Wikipedia</a>.)

<h2>About the Book</h2>

<p>Strauss's <i>Das Leben Jesu, kritisch bearbeitet</i> (<i>The Life of Jesus, Critically Examined</i>) was a sensation. While not denying that Jesus existed, Strauss did argue that the miracles in the New Testament were mythical re-tellings of normal events as supernatural happenings. Carl August von Eschenmayer wrote a review in 1835 called "The Iscariotism of our days," a review which Strauss characterized as 'the offspring of the legitimate marriage between theological ignorance and religious intolerance, blessed by a sleep-walking philosophy.' The Earl of Shaftesbury called the 1846 translation by Marian Evans "the most pestilential book ever vomited out of the jaws of hell." When Strauss was elected to a chair of theology in the University of Zürich, the appointment provoked such a storm of controversy that the authorities decided to pension him before he began his duties.

<p>What made <i>Das Leben Jesu</i> so controversial was Strauss's characterization of the miraculous elements in the gospels as being "mythical" in character. In analyzing the Bible in terms of self-coherence and paying attention to numerous contradictions, he rejected the actuality of the stories as "happenings" and read them solely on a mythic level. According to Strauss, the early church developed these miracle stories in order to present Jesus as the Messiah of the Jewish prophecies. This rationalist perspective was in direct opposition to the super-naturalist view that the bible was accurate both historically and spiritually.

<p>Strauss's Das Leben Jesu closed a period during which biblical scholars divided and wrestled over the "miraculous" nature of the New Testament. The "rationalists", deriving their views from the principles of the Enlightenment, found logical, rational explanations for the apparently miraculous occurrences. The "super-naturalists" in contrast defended not only the historical accuracy of the biblical accounts, but also the implicit and explicit claims of direct divine intervention. With time the book created a new epoch in the textual and historical treatment of the rise of Christianity.

<p>In 1840 and the following year Strauss published his <i>On Christian Doctrine</i> in two volumes. The main principle of this new work was that the history of Christian doctrines has basically been the history of their disintegration.

<h2>Preview</h2>

A preview of the text, with the Greek restored to its original script has been prepared and placed on line 
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.ph/previews/strauss/Strauss-LifeOfJesus.html">here</a>. You can use this to verify the Greek transcription, please do so. I will update this preview from time to time during the higher rounds. Please notify me in the forum if you notice any systematic issues in the transcription.

<h2>Proofing</h2>

<p>There is a lot of Greek in this book, roughly every few pages a few lines. I want to preserve the Greek
in the original script in the HTML version, so, to avoid having to redo all the Greek fragments, I kindly
request proofers to use a slightly different Greek transcription scheme, that allows for all
the accents to be represented.

<p>Most transcriptions are straightforward, based on their sound, some based on the similarity in shape. The one's that require some extra attention are marked red.

<p>Since most of the Greek fragments are Bible citations, they may be found on-line 
<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=SBLGNT&search=%20%CE%9A%CE%91%CE%A4%CE%91%20%CE%9C%CE%91%CE%A4%CE%98%CE%91%CE%99%CE%9F%CE%9D%201">here</a>. 

<p>There are also some fragments in (dotted) Hebrew. It is enough to mark them as <code>[Hebrew: **]</code> (let <code>[**Hebrew]</code> stand if it was done like that in the previous round).
I will take care of these during PP.



<p>A few pages are slightly blurred, still readable, but the OCR doesn't like them.

<h2>Formatting</h2>

<p>During the formatting rounds, please apply formatting to references to the Bible, as follows:

<p><b>Mark xvi, 8.</b>  becomes: <code>[bib:Mk 16:8|Mark xvi, 8].</code>

<p>that is, use the mark <code>[bib:</code> followed by a standardized notation, a pipe-symbol <code>|</code>, and then the reference as
it appears in the original text, closed by a <code>]</code>. Any following punctuation goes outside this mark-up.

<p>The titles of books are abbreviated, using standard abbreviations (see table below), and both chapter and verse are indicated by Arabic numbers, separated by a colon.

<p>References fully spelled out should also be marked:

<p><b>In the first Chapter of Mark, verse four...</b> becomes: <code>[bib:Mk 1:4|first Chapter of Mark, verse four]...</code>

<p>Ranges are indicated with a hyphen, as follows:

<p><b>Mark xvi, 8-10.</b>   becomes:  <code>[bib:Mk 16:8-10|Mark xvi, 8-10].</code>

<p>Subsequent citations to the same book or chapter are disambiguated, by repeating the coded form; the form in the text should remain the short form:

<p><b>Mark xvi, 8, 32.</b>  becomes:    <code>[bib:Mk 16:8|Mark xvi, 8], [bib:Mk 16:32|32].</code>

<p>and

<p><b>Mark xvi, 8; xvii, 32.</b>  becomes:   <code>[bib:Mk 16:8|Mark xvi, 8]; [bib:Mk 17:32|xvii, 32].</code>

<p>Note that in a paragraph dealing with a certain chapter, numerous references may need to be disambiguated this way.

<p>Now for the abbreviations of the books (Most references in this book are to the four gospels, so just remember <code>Mt Mk Lk Jn</code> to get started):
